# Project--NLP-Movie-Review-Part-2--

**In this project we'll be making a Linear SVC(Support Vector Classifier) model for predicting a movie review as a positive review or negative review in Natural Language Processing. It's Part 2 of previous project on this.** <br></br>


**Before jumping to the code lets understand Linear SVC(Model) and NLP(Natural Language Processing) First**...<br></br>

**What is Linear SVC?** <br></br>

Linear Support Vector Classification.

Similar to SVC with parameter kernel=‚Äôlinear‚Äô, but implemented in terms of liblinear rather than libsvm, so it has more flexibility in the choice of penalties and loss functions and should scale better to large numbers of samples.

The main differences between LinearSVC and SVC lie in the loss function used by default, and in the handling of intercept regularization between those two implementations.

This class supports both dense and sparse input and the multiclass support is handled according to a one-vs-the-rest scheme.<br></br>


**What is (NLP)Natural Language Processing**?<br></br>

NLP or Natural language processing is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and linguistics. It is primarily concerned with giving computers the ability to support and manipulate human language.<br></br>

NLP combines computational linguistics‚Äîrule-based modeling of human language‚Äîwith statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. Together, these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to ‚Äòunderstand‚Äô its full meaning, complete with the speaker or writer‚Äôs intent and sentiment.<br></br>

NLP drives computer programs that translate text from one language to another, respond to spoken commands, and summarize large volumes of text rapidly‚Äîeven in real time. There‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve interacted with NLP in the form of voice-operated GPS systems, digital assistants, speech-to-text dictation software, customer service chatbots, and other consumer conveniences. But NLP also plays a growing role in enterprise solutions that help streamline business operations, increase employee productivity, and simplify mission-critical business processes.<br></br>


**Important Note: Go through the .tsv file which contains the huge list of movie reviews with label (i.e pos vs neg) before jumping to the code.**
